If considerable changes have been made to your content, then this could be considered academic misconduct. Background research may be performed using GenAI but it is expected that any information obtained from GenAI is critically evaluated and validated using literature sources. Where you have used GenAI for proofreading it is still recommended to do final proofreading yourself as often technical terms can be changed altering the meaning completely. If you do use GenAI then you must acknowledge the use of it.
In the scientific literature, stand-alone literature reviews represent authoritative, overarching, wide reaching and up-to-date reports on a specific scientific topic. They rarely include new data, but instead are constructed through the summarising and critical analysis of previously published articles. As discussed in class, one of the primary purposes of a literature review is to highlight gaps in the current knowledge of the field with a view to suggesting areas for further research. The text will be referenced in a style. that is particular to the publishing journal.
Task:  
Write a sub-section of a literature review, that will be submitted to the International Journal of Mining Science and Technology, that will have the OVERALL TITLE:
Contributions of the Mining Industry to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 
This is a very broad topic and impossible to write about within the word limit. You should therefore select a sub-topic to write about in your review. Your assessment should start with the main title as above, and then a sub-title that you have created to reflect the topic that you will write about.
It is up to you what this subtopic will be. However a couple of suggestions are (but not limited to):
·   To focus on one specific aspect of the mining industry (e.g. exploration, processing, economics, resource efficiency, mining innovation or something else of you代 写CENG0037 Dissertation

·   Focus on one or two select SDGs and how various different aspects of the mining industry might contribute to this SDG
·   Case study focussing on a particular mining company
This is not an exhaustive list but as a guideline you should include:
·   A short introduction to the topic (briefly outlining the broad context).
·   An introduction to your chosen sub topic (being more specific and highlighting why it is important to discuss).
·   Concise critical analysis of the literature within this sub-topic.
·   A short concluding statement that brings the sub-section together highlighting any potential gaps for potential subsequent work.
Make sure you read the marking rubric to understand how marks will be awarded.
The audience you are writing this summary for is someone with a PhD in a science or engineering topic, but with only a superficial understanding of the resources sector. You must write your literature review so they can understand it.
You may use a maximum of 15 references. Please use the referencing style. of the journal ‘International Journal of Mining Science and Technology’. You must find the appropriate style. from their author guidelines. The idea here is that you are writing a review paper to be submitted to this journal, and so are required to follow their referencing guidelines. If you use the wrong referencing style, even if you have put appropriate references in, then you will loose marks.
Word limit: 1500 words, not including title or bibliography (you must state your word count at the end of the document). There will be no penalty for under length work, though note that work that is substantially under the word count is unlikely to meet the rubric effectively. There will be penalties applied to assignments that are over length by:
·   up to 5% (<1575 words) will receive a penalty of 5% reduction in the mark,
·   more than 5% (>1575 words) will receive a penalty of 10% reduction in the mark (no penalties will cause the mark to go below the pass mark of 50%)
